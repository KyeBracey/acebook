## What is it?

A rails application that attempts to duplicate the functionality of a popular social networking site.

## How Does it Work?

Using the navigation bar at the top of the website, you can make an account, log in, write posts, add comments, 'like' posts and upload a profile picture.

### Online
Heroku deployment pending- watch this space!

### Locally
- Clone this repository
- Navigate to the newly cloned directory via your command line
- ```rails db:create```
- ```rails db:migrate```
- ```rails server```
- Visit localhost:[whichever port you racked up to- 3000 by default]
- Make an account, write posts and leave intellectually stimulating comments!

## Our Approach

We used the first day of the week to research and understand Rails as no one in the group was familiar with it. After a lot of reading up and mobbing, we estimated features, divided them up into Trello board tickets and approached each one in pairs.
